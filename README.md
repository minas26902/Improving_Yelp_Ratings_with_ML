## Potential Questions (PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA AND KEEP ADDING QUESTIONS. WE CAN NARROW THESE DOWN LATER)

1. (ML) Are reviews highly correlated to quality (number of stars) ? Use ML to cluster data? Are they useful? 
2. What percentage talks about the food and what percentage talks about the service?
3. Is there a difference in reviews in touristy areas vs neighborhoods
4. Correlate captions to reviews
5. Correlate reviews for ethnic restaurants and to demographics of the area? Would need to add US Census data
6. Chain performance in different demographic areas? Would need Census data
7. (ML) Consistency in review style for a particular user?
8. Distribution of  ratings (stars). Is it a bell curve or does it lean more towards the extremes?
9. (ML) Pattern to Yelp Elite status? Elite vs non-elite

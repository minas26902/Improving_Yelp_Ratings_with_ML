## Potential Questions/Topics to explore (Team - PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THE DATA AND KEEP ADDING QUESTIONS. WE CAN NARROW THESE DOWN LATER)

1. (ML) Are yelp reviews highly correlated to restaurant quality (based on star rating) ? In other words, are the reviews useful? 
2. What percentage of reviews talk about the quality of the food versus the quality of the service?
3. Is there a difference in reviews in touristy versus local neighborhoods?
4. Correlate photo captions to reviews.
5. Correlate reviews for ethnic restaurants to demographics of the area. Would need to add U.S. Census data.
6. How do chain restaurant ratings compare in different demographic areas? Would need U.S. Census data.
7. (ML) Is there consistency in review style for a particular user?
8. Distribution of  ratings (stars)- Is it a bell curve or does it peak at both extremes (1 and/or 5 star ratings)?
9. (ML) Is there a pattern to Yelp Elite status? Elite vs non-elite.
